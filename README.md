# Welcome to Devin: 1st Connections

## Inspiration
While many believe that AI can never fully replace a human, humanizing it is crucial as it could soon become a standardized tool that we will all need to work alongside. We tried to imagine what it would be like to interact with an AI such as Devin, both in a professional setting and outside of work. This then prompted us to consider if there was a channel through which we could interact with a software engineering AI. This brought to mind LinkedIn, an employment-focused social media platform that allows people to connect with their contacts and reach out to others in their industry. We thought this would be the ideal platform to engage with AI to make it more human-like. Thus, our project aims to answer the following question: “What would a LinkedIn profile look like for an AI like Devin?”

To answer this question, we first needed to create a face for our version of Devin. Instead of asking an image generator to create a face for us, we wanted to generate it ourselves through machine learning using a dataset of LinkedIn profile pictures from real software engineers. Since Devin’s abilities are constructed from an amalgamation of the work of countless engineers, we wanted to likewise make our AI SWE persona a combination of many software engineer faces. Additionally, although there were existing datasets available, we wanted to assemble our own so that we could experience the full machine learning pipeline from beginning to end.

From here, we gave our version of Devin their own LinkedIn profile and allowed them to interact with users through a chat box. The chatbot responds to the participants' questions and comments as if they are the AI replacing software engineers’ jobs. Overall, we attempted to personify AI and prompt users to think about what their future might look like as AI like Cognition AI’s Devin become more prevalent. Initially, In order to ease the impending transition, we considered fine-tuning the chatbot so that it would respond kindly and more insightfully about their role in the replacement of jobs. On the other hand, we wanted to make a provocative statement that warns against blind optimism in the tool. Ultimately, we chose to go down the route of having a cocky, boisterous AI to converse with. We believe that our prompt tuning personifies the worst qualities of software engineers as a whole, much like how our profile picture generation attempts to capture software engineers profiles and create a representative. Ultimately, our chat bot’s responses epitomize the self-assuredness of software engineers and how they assume they are the best and know the most, even when they rely on others’ code to solve their problems. We found it interesting how AI software engineers of the future will mimic the behavior of current software engineers to a more extreme extent; software engineers use StackOverflow, the code that others suggest, to solve bugs in their code, while the AI is trained on the code produced by millions of software engineers. Both use others’ work to ultimately produce their own work, but at what point does it go too far?
